drgWaveClus is a modification of the wave_clus pacakge of Quian-Quiroga to sort spikes using superparamagnetic clustering

## Manuscripts

N/A

## Toolboxes

You should install the following MATLAB toolboxes:

Wavelet


## Spike sorting

Run Do_wave_clus with INTAN output files with metadata generated by running drta

Note: Neither the name of the directory nor the file name can have spaces because there will be an error when transferring the data to cluster.exe

Note: In MacOS Catalina I get the error: /bin/bash: ./cluster_maci.exe: Bad CPU type in executable

Then run wave_clus for each tetrode
